        About Our System
      </h2>
      <p className="text-md text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        This Health Care System prototype is more than just a tool—it is an
        innovation designed to reimagine how people understand and manage their
        health. In today’s world, where access to medical information can feel
        overwhelming and often unreliable, this prototype combines advanced
        artificial intelligence with trusted medical knowledge to provide safe,
        accurate, and timely health guidance. It is important to note that this
        is a prototype platform developed for research and improvement of health
        systems. No real personal information such as user names, actual
        hospital IDs, or passwords should ever be used within this system.

        At its core, the prototype uses state-of-the-art AI technology to
        analyze symptoms entered by users. By comparing reported conditions
        against a vast and continually updated medical knowledge base, it can
        generate meaningful insights that guide individuals toward the right
        course of action. Whether it’s suggesting a possible condition,
        recommending lifestyle adjustments, or advising when to consult a
        medical professional, this prototype acts as a supportive companion on
        every health journey. Unlike generic symptom checkers, the system adapts
        to user context, learns from anonymized interactions, and evolves over
        time to deliver increasingly relevant and reliable suggestions—all while
        serving its primary purpose as a research and innovation project to
        improve future healthcare systems.
